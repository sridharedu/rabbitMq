## 📘 **Project Title: "RabbitMQ Microservices Messaging Demo with Java & PostgreSQL"**

---

### 📝 **Project Description**

This is a hands-on Java-based microservices project that demonstrates **asynchronous communication using RabbitMQ**, combined with **PostgreSQL** for data persistence. The project showcases how to build **decoupled, event-driven services** that interact through messaging — a key architectural pattern in distributed systems.

The system includes:

* A **Producer Service** that publishes domain events to RabbitMQ (e.g., user signup or payment).
* A **Consumer Service** that receives these events and **persists the data** into a PostgreSQL database.

The goal is to give learners and interviewees a clear, working example of:

* RabbitMQ queues and exchanges,
* Inter-service communication,
* Message acknowledgments,
* And real-world persistence patterns using PostgreSQL.

All RabbitMQ infrastructure is run via **Docker Compose**, and the services are built using **Spring Boot**.

### ✅ **Acceptance Criteria**
# Most Important : Comment the code and explain the flow in simple terms — ideal for learning, walkthroughs, or interview discussions.
1. **Project Setup**

   * Docker Compose sets up:

     * RabbitMQ (with management UI)
     * PostgreSQL (for consumer service)
   * Two Spring Boot services:

     * `producer-service`
     * `consumer-service`

2. **Messaging Infrastructure**

   * One **Direct Exchange** (`user.direct`) with a bound queue.
   * One **Topic Exchange** (`events.topic`) with routing keys.
   * Queues and exchanges defined via Spring configuration or Java code.

3. **Producer Service**

   * Exposes REST endpoints:

     * `POST /signup` → Sends a `UserSignupEvent` to the direct exchange.
     * `POST /payment` → Sends a `PaymentEvent` to the topic exchange with a routing key.
   * Sends **Java POJOs** converted to JSON using RabbitTemplate.
   * No database required in the producer.

4. **Consumer Service**

   * Listens to queues from both exchanges.
   * Handles:

     * **Auto-acknowledged** message for one listener (e.g., user signup).
     * **Manually acknowledged** message for another listener (e.g., payment).
   * Persists received events into **PostgreSQL** using Spring Data JPA.

     * Tables: `users`, `payments` (or equivalent).
   * Logs all incoming messages to the console for traceability.

5. **PostgreSQL Integration**

   * PostgreSQL is connected only to the `consumer-service`.
   * Spring Data JPA is used for ORM mapping and data persistence.
   * DB schema is initialized using `schema.sql` or auto-creation via JPA.

6. **Code & Documentation**

   * Focused and clean code — only necessary logic included.
   * Light inline comments for important concepts (tutorial-friendly).
   * No UI or external APIs.
   * Docker Compose file includes all services and database.
   * Optional README explaining:

     * How to run services.
     * How to test messaging.
     * What to observe in logs and database.

7. **Learning Outcomes**

   * Understand RabbitMQ’s role in asynchronous, decoupled systems.
   * Use RabbitMQ Direct and Topic exchanges effectively.
   * Learn how to implement message acknowledgment (auto and manual).
   * Persist messages/events using PostgreSQL.
   * Realize the flow of event-driven architecture in a practical, minimal setup.

Let me know if you'd like me to generate:

* A folder structure,
* `docker-compose.yml`,
* Entity classes and JPA setup,
* Exchange and queue configurations,
  to accelerate implementation.

---

**TICKET 3:** `RABBIT-003` – Set up basic application.yml configuration files in both services.

> Configure connection settings for RabbitMQ (both), and PostgreSQL (consumer only).

---

### 📨 **Epic 2: RabbitMQ Infrastructure**

---

**TICKET 4:** `RABBIT-004` – Create RabbitMQ Direct Exchange configuration in both services.

> Exchange name: `user.direct`. Add inline comments explaining direct exchange routing.

---

**TICKET 5:** `RABBIT-005` – Create RabbitMQ Topic Exchange configuration.

> Exchange name: `events.topic`. Explain routing pattern use cases via comments.

---

**TICKET 6:** `RABBIT-006` – Create durable queues and bindings for both exchanges.

> Include educational inline comments on how queues, bindings, and routing keys interact.

---

### 🚀 **Epic 3: Producer Service Logic**

---

**TICKET 7:** `RABBIT-007` – Implement REST endpoint `POST /signup` to send `UserSignupEvent` to direct exchange.

> Use RabbitTemplate to send serialized POJO. Comment why this pattern helps decoupling.

---

**TICKET 8:** `RABBIT-008` – Implement REST endpoint `POST /payment` to send `PaymentEvent` to topic exchange.

> Use a specific routing key like `payment.card` or `payment.wallet`. Explain routing in code.
